- : APM Boot camp - From the formative two weeks I spent along with my cohort getting a crash course on all things Uber and product, to the many years of boot camp I’ve had the opportunity to participate in as a facilitator and speaker, I can’t think of a more special part of the APM program.
- : APM Trip, recruitment, close post-college community, lasting friendships
- : I decided to explore the Delivery side of the business for my second rotation as part of the Uber Eats Consumer Growth team. There, I helped scale our ML platforms to optimize Uber’s marketing outreach to millions of consumers and drive millions in incremental gross bookings.
- : I worked on Reservations, Uber’s new schedule ahead product, in my first rotation. I was part of a vertical team that owned everything from how we priced rides and matched drivers to the design of the app experience. I had the chance to work on all aspects of the launch of UberX Reservations in over 40 cities in the US.
- : In my current role, I lead Driver Pricing product for our Rides business alongside a talented and dynamic team. I’m grateful for the opportunity to have explored different rotations to find a space that is intellectually exciting for me and drives massive business impact for the company. Since graduating, I’ve had the opportunity to mentor and manage other APMs and give back to a program that has helped me grow and establish myself as a leader.
- : Late night hang outs with the APMs during our trip to Miami
- : To round out my APM experience, I joined the Earner Discovery team, thinking about how to build the Uber Driver app to empower earners to succeed on the Uber platform. Our team builds scalable UX platforms that can be leveraged by stakeholders globally to provide Earners with tools to maximize their earnings with Uber. This includes thinking deeply about the Driver app’s holistic design as well as how we use ML to personalize the app experience to each Earner.
- A never-ending desire to grow and learn
- A true passion for Uber's mission, vision, products, and users
- A “go-get” personality—biased toward action, and constantly pushing toward clarity and delivery
- APMs are given the mentorship and tools to succeed personally and professionally. Other than direct managers, APMs are paired with senior product leaders for career direction. APMs collaborate continually and form friendships for life.
- APMs work on teams across all areas of the business. APMs get full autonomy in choosing areas they are interested in. Some of the projects that APMs have driven:

- After boot camp, you’re a mini-expert on Uber ready to tackle your first rotation. You get matched, then you're up and running on a team. First-rotation APMs work on a team with a senior PM who provides active coaching and mentorship. With each subsequent rotation, you learn to take on more responsibility across various organizations that you choose.

- For my second rotation, I wanted to be closer to what makes Uber, Uber. So I joined the Driver Pricing & Incentives team which is the team that finds ways to incentivize drivers to get on the road during peak times and to drive more frequently. I learnt about the complexities of driver supply, the needs of our driver partners and how to create experiences that make earning more simple.

- Uber for Business x3
- Uber for Business
- Uber is a global technology company—every feature we ship has to work in the 10,000+ cities where Uber is available. APMs take a research trip to 4 cities around the world to build empathy for market-specific needs.
- Uber is, at heart, both a powerful technology company and a hyperlocal business, and this model has scaled to more than 10,000 cities. We build products for markets across the world with their own cultural, regulatory and customer differences.
- Uber went from zero to 5 billion trips in 7 years, and 5 billion to 10 billion trips in one year. We have groups working on everything from micromobility  to trucking to grocery deliveries to autonomous vehicles. There is something for everyone here.

- Wine x2

The trip gives your APM class the chance to develop empathy for market needs around the world and use this global product perspective to help inform product priorities and opportunities.
