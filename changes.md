+ : APM Boot camp - From the formative two weeks I spent along with my cohort getting a crash course on all things Uber and product, to the many years of boot camp I’ve had the opportunity to participate in as a facilitator and speaker, I can’t think of a more special part of the APM program.
+ : APM Trip, recruitment, close post-college community, lasting friendships
+ : I decided to explore the Delivery side of the business for my second rotation as part of the Uber Eats Consumer Growth team. There, I helped scale our ML platforms to optimize Uber’s marketing outreach to millions of consumers and drive millions in incremental gross bookings.
+ : I worked on Reservations, Uber’s new schedule ahead product, in my first rotation. I was part of a vertical team that owned everything from how we priced rides and matched drivers to the design of the app experience. I had the chance to work on all aspects of the launch of UberX Reservations in over 40 cities in the US.
+ : In my current role, I lead Driver Pricing product for our Rides business alongside a talented and dynamic team. I’m grateful for the opportunity to have explored different rotations to find a space that is intellectually exciting for me and drives massive business impact for the company. Since graduating, I’ve had the opportunity to mentor and manage other APMs and give back to a program that has helped me grow and establish myself as a leader.
+ : Late night hang outs with the APMs during our trip to Miami
+ : To round out my APM experience, I joined the Earner Discovery team, thinking about how to build the Uber Driver app to empower earners to succeed on the Uber platform. Our team builds scalable UX platforms that can be leveraged by stakeholders globally to provide Earners with tools to maximize their earnings with Uber. This includes thinking deeply about the Driver app’s holistic design as well as how we use ML to personalize the app experience to each Earner.
+ A never-ending desire to grow and learn
+ A true passion for Uber's mission, vision, products, and users
+ A “go-get” personality—biased toward action, and constantly pushing toward clarity and delivery
+ APMs are given the mentorship and tools to succeed personally and professionally. Other than direct managers, APMs are paired with senior product leaders for career direction. APMs collaborate continually and form friendships for life.
+ APMs work on teams across all areas of the business. APMs get full autonomy in choosing areas they are interested in. Some of the projects that APMs have driven:

+ For my second rotation, I wanted to be closer to what makes Uber, Uber. So I joined the Driver Pricing & Incentives team which is the team that finds ways to incentivize drivers to get on the road during peak times and to drive more frequently.

+ Uber embraces a learn-by-doing philosophy. APMs start shipping high-impact products the moment they join Uber. Additionally, three rotations allow APMs to get a breadth of skills across different Uber products in different verticals, ranging from Driver Experience to Uber for Business.
+ Uber for Business x3
+ Uber for Business
+ Uber is a global technology company—every feature we ship has to work in the 10,000+ cities where Uber is available. APMs take a research trip to 4 cities around the world to build empathy for market-specific needs.
+ Uber is, at heart, both a powerful technology company and a hyperlocal business, and this model has scaled to more than 10,000 cities. We build products for markets across the world with their own cultural, regulatory and customer differences.
+ Uber went from zero to 5 billion trips in 7 years, and 5 billion to 10 billion trips in one year. We have groups working on everything from micromobility  to trucking to grocery deliveries to autonomous vehicles. There is something for everyone here.

+ We look for recent university grads with a technical background (computer science degree or equivalent) graduating this year or within one year of graduation. Aside from that, we look for candidates with the following qualities:
+ What do APMs do after the program?
+ What is the interview process like?
+ What is the structure of the APM program?
+ What kind of background do I need to be an APM?
+ What types of teams will I get to work on?
+ Wine x2
+ With one rotation under your belt, you join your class on a world tour to 4 of Uber’s most operationally challenging and unique cities. The trip gives your APM class the chance to develop empathy for market needs around the world and use this global product perspective to help inform product priorities and opportunities.
+ Work across Engineering, Design, Data Science, and Operations to ship high-impact products end to end.
+ Work that moves you
+ World trip
+ You are the true owner of your Uber APM experience. You can experience building zero -> one projects, develop revolutionary new products, manage integrations, and iterate on existing core products touching millions of lives every day.
+ You will join 3 teams over the course of 24 months across all of Uber, including but not limited to Rider, Driver, Merchant, Courier, New Verticals, Uber Freight, and Platforms, leading into a Product Manager role.
